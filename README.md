# EndlessOceanRunner
# Overview

Using Unity, I developed this endless runner game called "Endless Ocean Runner." The game features a fish navigating through the ocean while dodging predators and collecting treasures. The goal is to survive as long as possible and gather as much treasure as you can. To play the game, the player controls the fish's movement using the up and down arrow keys. The fish automatically moves forward with the game screen. 

My purpose for developing this software was to learn how to program in Unity and increase my skills in game development. While creating this endless ocean runner game, my aim was to deepen my understanding of fundamental game mechanics and improve my ability to design engaging user interfaces.
